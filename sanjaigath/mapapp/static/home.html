            Arani (also spelled Aarani) is a historic town in the Tiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu, India. It is well known for its rich silk weaving industry, producing high-quality Arni silk sarees that are famous across the state. Arni is located on the banks of the Kamandalan River and has a strong cultural and traditional background. It's also close to the holy city of Tiruvannamalai, known for the Arunachaleswarar Temple. Arni serves as a commercial hub for nearby villages and plays an important role in Tamil Naduâ€™s handloom and textile heritage.
