            The Cup and Saucer Waterfalls is a hidden gem near Vellore. As the name suggests, the shape of the rock formations around the waterfall looks like a cup and saucer, giving it its unique name. Surrounded by lush greenery, it's a peaceful spot ideal for short treks and relaxing by nature. Though not very commercialized, it's loved by locals and perfect for a quiet escape.
