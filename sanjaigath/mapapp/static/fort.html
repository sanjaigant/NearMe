            Vellore Fort is a historic fort located in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. Built in the 16th century by the Vijayanagara kings, it is famous for its massive granite walls, wide moat, and rich history. The fort has seen the rule of several dynasties including the Bijapur Sultans, the Marathas, the Carnatic Nawabs, and the British. Inside the fort, you'll find important structures like the Jalakandeswarar Temple, a church, and a mosque, showing its multi-religious heritage. It also played a role during the Vellore Mutiny of 1806, one of the first uprisings against British rule in India.
